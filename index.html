               <h2 id="About">About More Puppets</h2>
               <p>More puppets is an authentic derivative of the esoteric and absurd <a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/opium" target="_blank">Ord Puppet Inu Undoxxed Millionaire</a> and <a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets" target="_blank">Bitcoin Puppets</a> 
                  They are more products from the fringes of the karmic grid, where the most unconventional and offbeat ideas are born. Not intended for use as anything more than art. No more roadmaps, more promises and no more guarantees or any more of that nonsense.

                     More Puppets are mere scribes who carefully lifted every trait and faithfully recreated the three bases from O.P.I.U.M. that weren‚Äôt used in Bitcoin Puppets.</p>

               <h2 id="collabs">Collabs</h2>
               <p>art in it's purest form, is a manifestation of individuality. the no collab thesis asserts that the very essence of bitcoin puppets unique vision and narrative of a single artist. the artistic expression flourishes, unbridled by compromise or dilution.
                  collaborations in the ordinals/NFT ecosystem often devolve into attention-grabbing spectacles, where the collective effort overshadows the intrinsic value. the no collab thesis liberates the project from the pressure to conform to trends or compromise on integrity for the sake of visibility.<br>
                  <br>
                  the allure of collaboration often masks a perilous reality. (despite the often thought off win win scenario). the devaluation of the project. when art becomes a mere utility, a means to an end in a collaborative endeavor, it's inherent value is compromised. the no collab thesis acts as a guardian against such devaluation, ensuring the project is not reduced to a mere cog in a collective machine.<br>
                  <br>
                  and besides there is no project and no team to collab with.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  as a derivative the core values of MORE Puppets are birthed from O.P.I.U.M. and Bitcoin Puppets. this art is subject to its destined fate, without central authority and mono-direction.
